- I summarise what I considered the most important points, but the course provides more details. Consider taking it if you find these useful.

Use Analogies
-------------
- Makes learning easier, as it refers concepts already well-known. 
- Tell AI what areas of knowledge you are strong with or other background information/interests.
- Favor several analogies over of just one. Their match will not be perfect, so having several we'll get a more accurate picture.
- **Example:** GPT is just one AI model of many out there, but the knowledge is highly transferrable (e.g. knowing how to drive a car, the type of engine (electrical/diesel/etc) doesn't matter much).

AI as a learning tool (background trivia)
-----------------------------------------
- Always useful to ask the AI to take the role of an expert on the field.
- Average IQ increased in USA from 1930 to 1970s (partly to widespread education).
- Average IQ decreased in USA from 1970s onwards (correlates with widespread use of calculators).
- Used correctly, AI can empower us, not just dumb us down (like calculators?).
- A useful advantage of AI over humans is its capacity to handle big working memory loads (people usally top with a few items/numbers at once).


Ask to build knowledge
----------------------
- GPT may provide variations on existing exam problems. Also examples and solutions.
- Avoid asking for an answer. Ask for ideas, perspectives, approaches... to correct, improve and analyse attempts.
- Never ask for "1" of anything... avoid the direct answer. Reasoning which one to choose and why strengthens knowledge.
- Avoid biases (esp. confirmation) by asking the AI to give multiple conflicting opinions.
- **Example**: what are the 5 questions that if I can answer means I underdstood the material? Focus on aspects A, B and C of the presentation.

GPT with existing documents
---------------------------
- Why? Information retrieval achieves better results than re-reading a text or underlining its most important parts.
- Load docs in chatGPT (make sure there's enouh tokens available to load the whole text plus provide answers).
- Ask (to be asked) pre-testing questions (to highlight most important material). Useful before studying to highlight and be more conscious on the most relevant material.
- On boring topics, ask AI to provoke curiosity. This will help persevere with motivation and be more receptive and focused for longer periods of time.

Example starting prompts
------------------------
"""
Act an expert in breaking down complex topics and teaching through simple analogies and metaphors.
Teach me [PLACEHOLDER_FOR_TOPIC] one step at a time. After you teach me each topic, ask me a question to asses my understanding. Adapt what you teach next or review based on how well I answer the question. Suggest topics I should focus on to improve my understanding.
Teach me the first thing.
"""

"""
Whenever I ask a question, suggest a better version of it, clearer and more specific. Ask me if you should answer that one instead.
"""

An alternative to the above example follows:
"""
Whenever I ask a question, think of four more specific questions that if you had the answer, you could better answer the original question. Then ask me if you should answer those questions before answering the original question
"""

"""
Act as an entrenched skeptic. Challenge my thinking on [PLACEHOLDER_FOR_DOCUMENT_OR_TOPIC]. Identify my assumptions and challenge them.
Ask me pointed questions one at a time to challenge my assumptions. Be persistent and don't let me off the hook easily. Challenge the assumptions underlying my answers.
Ask me the first question.
