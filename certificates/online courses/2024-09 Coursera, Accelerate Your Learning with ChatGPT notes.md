- I summarise what I considered the most important points, but the course provides more details. Consider taking it if you find these useful.

Use Analogies
-------------
- Makes learning easier, as it refers concepts already well-known. 
- Tell AI what areas of knowledge you are strong with or other background information/interests.
- Favor several analogies over of just one. Their match will not be perfect, so having several we'll get a more accurate picture.
- **Example:** GPT is just one AI model of many out there, but the knowledge is highly transferrable (e.g. knowing how to drive a car, the type of engine (electrical/diesel/etc) doesn't matter much).

AI as a learning tool (background trivia)
-----------------------------------------
- Always useful to ask the AI to take the role of an expert on the field.
- Average IQ increased in USA from 1930 to 1970s (partly to widespread education).
- Average IQ decreased in USA from 1970s onwards (correlates with widespread use of calculators).
- Used correctly, AI can empower us, not just dumb us down (like calculators?)

Ask to build knowledge
----------------------
- GPT may provide variations on existing exam problems. Also examples and solutions.
- Avoid asking for an answer. Ask for ideas, perspectives, approaches... to correct, improve and analyse attempts.
- Never ask for "1" of anything... avoid the direct answer. Reasoning which one to choose and why strengthens knowledge.
- Avoid biases (esp. confirmation) by asking the AI to give multiple conflicting opinions.
- **Example**: what are the 5 questions that if I can answer means I underdstood the material? Focus on aspects A, B and C of the presentation.
