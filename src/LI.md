#### **Preply**
**Title:** `Staff-Equivalent Backend Engineer (P7)`
**Dates:** `Jun 2022 – Jul 2024`

```
I shaped the technical roadmap and led initiatives that directly influenced the company's bottom line and engineering culture.

- Business Impact: Championed and delivered the "Postpone Billing" experiment, the company's #1 most impactful initiative of 2023 out of 215 A/B tests, resulting in a +3% global Gross Margin lift. See isaacbernat.com/cv#casestudy-postpone-billing

- Technical Foresight: Advocated for a phased, iterative approach on a key company initiative, providing foresight that was eventually adopted after the initial "big bang" approach proved too complex, mitigating over 10k+ hours in potential wasted development.

- Proactive Ownership: Identified and led the mitigation of critical bugs outside my team's domain, including a flaw that cost over $21k per week and a task that spammed our queue with over 1M executions per hour.
```

**Title:** `Senior Backend Engineer (P6)`
**Dates:** `Mar 2020 – Jun 2022`

```
As the founding backend architect for the Subscription MVP, I led the technical transition from a package-only model to a recurring revenue system that became the company's primary growth engine.

- Modernization & Performance: Led the backend migration of a high-traffic (1M+ MAU) app to a GraphQL API. This improved page load times by ~85% and unblocked A/B tests that resulted in an +800% CVR increase.

- Subscription Architecture: This foundational work resulted in a +41% YoY increase in LTV (increasing LTV-to-CAC from 1.4x to 3.0x), grew to 200k+ monthly renewals and was instrumental in securing a Series C funding round. See isaacbernat.com/cv#casestudy-subscription-model

- Incident Management: Commanded over 15 production incidents and used the post-mortem from a critical SEV-2 to establish a mandatory, company-wide policy on pre-launch monitoring. See isaacbernat.com/cv#casestudy-incident-74

- Team Scaling: Helped build the dedicated Subscriptions team by hiring 2 foundational engineers and improved team agility by redesigning our sprint retrospective process.
