# Code samples

Type `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` after cloning the repository to get the latest versions.

**Note:** These samples (especially the older ones) may not accurately reflect my current views and knowledge on specific topics. I wanted to keep them faithful to the original sources instead of updating them. That is because this way they offer a better insight in the way I approach problems and design solutions.
